# claude-bridge smoke drivers

Operator-facing smoke scripts. Not part of `cargo test` — driven by hand
when you want to exercise the bridge against the real `claude` CLI.

| Script | What it does |
|---|---|
| `stdio_smoke.sh` | Spawns `cargo run -p remora-claude-bridge` in stdio mode and feeds it a scripted JSON-RPC sequence (`initialize` → `thread/start` → `turn/start "say hi in one word"` → wait for `turn/completed`). Talks to **real claude**. Requires `claude` on `$PATH` and `jq`. |

## Running

```bash
# stdio smoke against real claude:
./crates/claude-bridge/tests/smoke/stdio_smoke.sh

```

## CI coverage

The Rust integration tests (`tests/smoke_in_process.rs`,
`tests/smoke_binary.rs`, `tests/fake_claude_smoke.rs`) cover the same
flow via the `fake-claude` test binary, so CI doesn't depend on a real
`claude` install. The bash driver is the live-Claude counterpart to run before
tagging a release.
